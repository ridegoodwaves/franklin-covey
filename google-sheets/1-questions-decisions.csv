Q1,Phase 0 - Blocker,"Third-party DPAs: Resend requires a DPA. Should we use Resend or switch to AWS SES (FedRAMP-authorized)?",P0 - Blocker,Client IT,2026-02-10,Partially Resolved,"Calendly API removed (no DPA needed for link-based scheduling). Resend DPA still needs confirmation, or switch to AWS SES.",,Partial,"Calendly DPA resolved (no API = no DPA). Email provider DPA still open."
Q2,Phase 0 - Blocker,"Scheduling approach: How should participants book sessions with coaches?",P0 - Blocker,Amit + Client,2026-02-10,Resolved - Client Confirmed,"Calendly API integration removed. Each coach's existing Calendly link stored as meetingBookingUrl and displayed behind 'Book Next Session' button. Coaches' existing workflow unchanged. Client confirmed (2026-02-11): 'The original plan MVP was to just take each individual coach's scheduling link and hide it behind a button' — which is exactly what this delivers.",2026-02-11,Yes,"Client confirmed 2026-02-11. Initial miscommunication: client thought we were removing Calendly entirely. Clarified that we removed the API layer only — coach Calendly links are fully supported."
Q3,Phase 0 - Blocker,"Cloud provider: Which cloud (AWS / Azure / GCP) and region? Affects deployment architecture and data residency.",P0 - Blocker,Client IT,2026-02-10,Open,,,,Longest lead-time item. Everything else depends on this.

Q5,IT - Pre-Development,"Deployment model: Do we get access to deploy into client cloud account, or does client team handle deployments? We deliver a Docker image.",P0 - Blocker,Client IT,2026-02-10,Open,,,,Need to know if we push to their container registry or get CI/CD access.
Q6,IT - Pre-Development,"Database provisioning: Who provisions the managed PostgreSQL 16 instance (RDS / Cloud SQL / Azure Database)? What is the approval process and lead time? Min: db.t3.medium (400 max connections).",P0 - Blocker,Client IT,2026-02-10,Open,,,,Database setup has longest lead time after cloud provider decision.
Q7,IT - Pre-Development,"Container orchestration: Does the client already run containers? ECS Fargate / Cloud Run / Azure Container Apps / Kubernetes? If yes, we match existing. If no, who sets up the container service?",P0 - Blocker,Client IT,2026-02-10,Open,,,,
Q8,IT - Pre-Development,"DNS and domain: What URL will this live at (e.g. coaching.franklincovey.com)? Who controls DNS? Process and lead time for CNAME/A record?",P0 - Blocker,Client IT,2026-02-10,Open,,,,
Q9,IT - Pre-Staging,"Secrets management: AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault / GCP Secret Manager / env vars? We need to store 5-6 secrets (DATABASE_URL, HMAC_SECRET, email API key, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, CRON_SECRET, SENTRY_DSN).",P1 - High,Client IT,2026-02-10,Open,,,,

Q13,IT - Pre-Staging,"Email 'From' address and domain: e.g. coaching@franklincovey.com. Need DNS access for SPF/DKIM records, or client team sets those up.",P1 - High,Client IT,2026-02-10,Open,,,,
Q14,IT - Pre-Staging,"Coach identity provider: Are coaches on FranklinCovey SSO (Okta / Azure AD / Google Workspace)? Could use for coach/admin login instead of magic links. If independent contractors, magic links are correct.",P1 - High,Client IT / PM,2026-02-10,Open,,,,Affects auth architecture.
Q15,IT - Pre-Staging,"Backup and DR expectations: Specific RPO/RTO requirements? Cross-region replication needed?",P2 - Medium,Client IT,2026-02-10,Open,,,,

Recommendation: Option A is more secure.",P1 - High,Client / PM,2026-02-10,Open,,,,Option B requires rate-limiting the email lookup.
Q20,v2 Feature,"Chemistry interview scope: Consolidated review recommends deferring entirely. If client disagrees, it adds 2 states, 4+ transitions, and causes 5/8 CRITICAL edge cases. Does both coach AND participant need to confirm?",P2 - Medium,Client / PM,2026-02-10,Open,,,,Deferred per technical review. Need client buy-in.

Client sees industry disruption and wants to transform their delivery model.",P1 - High,Client / PM,2026-02-11,Confirmed via CIL Brief,"Greg Smith (VP) directive: 'build the overall portal architecture for ALL of FranklinCovey's coaching engagements, then fill in this immediate use case first.' CIL Brief confirms: 150+ coaches worldwide, 250+ active engagements, 65+ client orgs. $6.9M USPS deal in pipeline where data reporting is key criterion.",2026-02-11,Yes,"CIL Brief provides full business context. Platform vision confirmed at VP level."
Q28,Strategic,"What other engagement types does FranklinCovey run beyond 1:1 coaching? (Group coaching, workshops, assessments, multi-day programs?)",P2 - Medium,Client / PM,2026-02-11,Partially Answered,"CIL Brief confirms: Group Coaching exists (Kari tracks several group engagements with separate reporting/metrics).

PRD has shuffle+take 3. These are different approaches. Must resolve for March 2 Coach Selector."

Recommendation: Option A is more secure.",P1 - High,Client / PM,2026-02-10,Answered via CIL Brief,"CIL Brief says: 'Participant receives email link, enters approved email, sees 3 available coaches' + 'No login required.' This is Option B (generic link + email lookup). Rate-limiting on email lookup is required.",2026-02-11,Pending,"CIL Brief confirms Option B. Simplifies auth significantly — no HMAC tokens needed. Just email verification against approved list."
