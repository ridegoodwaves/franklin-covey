# External Update Share Layer

This folder is the stakeholder share layer for Tim updates.

## Source of Truth

The canonical project decisions live in repo docs:
- `franklin-covey/docs/plans/2026-02-18-fc-project-plan.md`
- `franklin-covey/docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-mvp-backend-vertical-slices-plan.md`
- `franklin-covey/docs/drafts/2026-02-18-mvp-contract-v1.md`

## Files to Keep Current

Update these three files for external sharing:
- `timeline.md`
- `blockers.md`
- `decisions.md`

## Update Workflow

1. Update canonical docs first.
2. Sync these three files from canonical docs.
3. Set `Last synced` date in each file.
4. Share these files (or copy to Google Sheets/Docs) as the external view.

## Sync Rule

- One-way sync only: canonical docs -> share layer.
- Do not edit canonical decisions directly in the share layer.
