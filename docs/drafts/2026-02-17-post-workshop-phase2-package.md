**Date:** 2026-02-17  
**Purpose:** Prepare a post-workshop commercial and delivery path that turns the USPS MVP into a broader FranklinCovey coaching platform engagement.

## How This Draft Was Built

This draft is **source-led, assumption-light**:

- **Primary source docs used**
  - `docs/workshop-agenda-feb-18.md`
  - `docs/drafts/2026-02-16-workshop-open-questions.md`
  - `docs/drafts/2026-02-16-workshop-prep-note-to-tim.md`
  - `docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-mvp-backend-vertical-slices-plan.md`
  - `docs/brainstorms/2026-02-12-mvp-ship-strategy-brainstorm.md`
  - `docs/CIL-BRIEF-DELTA-ANALYSIS.md`
  - `docs/note-to-tim-proposal-flags.md`
  - `/Users/amitbhatia/.cursor/prd_for_apps/franklincovey-coaching-platform-prd.md`

- **Rule used for drafting**
  - If a statement is already in docs, it is treated as a working fact.
  - If a statement is commercial/organizational and not explicit in docs, it is marked as an assumption to validate after the Feb 18 workshop.

## 1) Phase 2 One-Pager (Positioning + Offer)

### Positioning Statement (External)

"The March MVP is the first production program on a scalable coaching platform. Phase 2 focuses on stabilizing launch operations, reducing manual reporting effort, and expanding the system so FranklinCovey can onboard additional programs and clients with less operational overhead."

### Why This Lands with FC Stakeholders

- **Greg lens (VP):** build once, reuse across engagements; improve operating leverage.
- **Carrie lens (Director of Coaching):** stable baseline that creates room for better coaching experiences.
- **Andrea lens (Ops):** proactive exception management and lower reporting burden.

### Phase 2 Objectives (90 days)

1. Convert launch MVP into repeatable operations.
2. Reduce manual admin/reporting effort with reliable workflows.
3. Harden platform foundations for multi-program and future multi-org growth.
4. Establish a joint operating cadence (decision speed, backlog, releases).

### Phase 2 Scope Tracks

**Track A: Stabilization and Launch Hardening**
- Production incident handling and bug triage
- Data quality checks and operational dashboards
- SLA-backed support windows and escalation path

**Track B: Reporting and Admin Productization**
- Incremental monthly reporting workflow (new activity only)
- Print/export refinements for stakeholder reporting
- Admin workflow hardening for imports, validation, and corrections

**Track C: Platform Foundation**
- Multi-program governance patterns in admin UX
- Organization-aware data boundaries (foundation for future client expansion)
- Security/compliance hardening needed for broader rollout

### Delivery Model

- Weekly decision + roadmap sync (30-45 min, named decision owner on FC side)
- Weekly release rhythm (small, shippable increments)
- Single shared source of truth: decisions, blockers, timeline

## 2) Post-MVP Pricing Ladder (Commercial Expansion)

Use this as a menu, not a commitment. Pick one lane after workshop decisions are locked.

### Option A: Stabilize + Operate (30 days)

- **Price:** $12,000-$18,000 fixed
- **Use when:** FC wants low-risk continuity right after launch
- **Includes:** hypercare, bug fixes, light enhancements, weekly ops reporting
- **Excludes:** net-new platform modules

### Option B: Stabilize + Build (90 days)

- **Price:** $45,000-$75,000 fixed (or T&M equivalent)
- **Use when:** FC wants to turn MVP into a durable operating system
- **Includes:** Option A + reporting productization + admin workflow hardening + platform foundation items
- **Contract structure:** milestone-based with explicit scope gates at day 30 and day 60

### Option C: Fractional Platform Lead (Quarterly retainer)

- **Price:** $8,000-$15,000/month retainer + scoped build sprints
- **Use when:** FC wants ongoing strategy + delivery leadership without hiring full internal team immediately
- **Includes:** product/technical leadership, roadmap ownership, release governance, vendor/infra coordination

### Suggested Commercial Guardrails (all options)

- Named FC decision owner with 24-hour turnaround target for blocking decisions
- Change order path for net-new features outside agreed milestones
- Explicit acceptance criteria per milestone

## 3) 90-Day Expansion Roadmap (Post-MVP)

### Days 0-30: Stabilize and Instrument

- Lock production support protocol and owner map
- Baseline key KPIs (activation, coach selection completion, session logging compliance, reporting turnaround time)
- Fix high-severity defects and remove launch friction points
- Confirm production-safe test strategy and release checklist

**Exit gate:** stable weekly releases and no unresolved P1 defects.

### Days 31-60: Productize Admin + Reporting

- Deliver "new activity only" reporting flow aligned to FC reporting expectations
- Harden import pipeline with better validation and operator feedback loops
- Improve executive summary clarity for leadership consumption
- Finalize role-appropriate dashboard views per validated workshop decisions

**Exit gate:** reporting cycle can run without manual heroics.

### Days 61-90: Scale Foundations

- Complete organization-aware scoping approach for future clients/programs
- Formalize data boundaries, auditability, and access patterns for expansion
- Prepare expansion backlog for next 2-3 programs with effort bands
- Publish Year-1 platform roadmap and investment model

**Exit gate:** approved backlog and commercial path for Phase 3 buildout.

## 4) Assumptions Ledger (What Is Source-Backed vs Assumed)

### Source-Backed (from project docs)

- March 2 coach selector and March 16 broader portal deadlines are critical.
- Current engagement is strategic beyond one project (platform foundation intent).
- Multi-program requirements are active now; multi-org is expected directionally.
- Workshop goal is to lock scope, decisions, and tradeoffs using real data/constraints.
- Data availability and decision speed are major schedule drivers.

### Assumptions to Validate in/after Workshop

1. FC agrees to a formal post-MVP phase rather than ad hoc extensions.
2. FC can assign a single operational decision owner for 24-hour turnaround.
3. Reporting improvements are prioritized as a budgeted workstream (not "nice to have").
4. Budget authority exists for a Phase 2 engagement that exceeds the current MVP cap.
5. Infrastructure/security constraints will not block weekly release cadence.

### Assumption Handling Rule

- Any assumption not confirmed by workshop readback becomes a tracked risk with an owner/date, not hidden scope.

## 5) Suggested Workshop Close Script (30-60 seconds)

"To keep March delivery stable and avoid one-off rework, we propose a two-step path: complete this MVP launch with strict scope lock, then move immediately into a 90-day stabilization-and-scale phase focused on reporting reliability, admin efficiency, and platform readiness for additional programs. If this approach works for your team, we'll bring a concrete option set with milestones and decision gates."
